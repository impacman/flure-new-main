## 10. DISPUTE RESOLUTION

These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Singapore. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Use will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision hereof is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use will remain in effect.

You will attempt to resolve all disputes with respect to the Services offered by us through communication with our Customer Support Team. If parties are unable to resolve the dispute in 60 days, then such dispute or difference arising out of or in connection with Flure and/or the Terms shall be resolved by binding arbitration under the LCIA Rules, rather than in court.

The number of arbitrators shall be three. The arbitration shall take place in London, UK. The language to be used in the arbitral proceedings shall be English. The governing law of this Agreement shall be the substantive law of the country of incorporation of the Company owning Arabiandate.com. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. Arbitrators, however, can award you the same damages and relief, and must honor the same terms in this Agreement, as a court would. The LCIA's Rules are available at www.lcia.org/Dispute_Resolution_Services/lcia-arbitration-rules-2014. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the LCIA's rules. We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. The arbitrator may award money or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. No class or representative or private attorney general theories of liability or prayers for relief may be maintained in any arbitration held under this agreement. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.

Please also note should you chargeback any transactions billed to your account, Flure may be required to disclose any and/or all private communications sent/received by You through our Service in order to prove the validity of the charges billed to Your account and Flure's privacy policy will therefore not restrain any such disclosures.

## 11. CLIENTS’ DISPUTE RESOLUTION

Clients are solely responsible for their interactions with other Flure’s Clients. Flure reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor disputes between Clients.

## 12. TERM

These Terms will remain in full force and effect while You use Flure and/or are a Client of Flure. You may terminate Your subscription at any time, for any reason, effective upon receipt of Your written notice of termination by Flure’s Customer support.

## 13. INDEMNITY

Hereby you agree to indemnify Flure, our affiliates, subsidiaries, partners, officers, directors, employees, contractors and suppliers from and against any and all claims, obligations, actions, losses, liability, demands, costs and any other damages including but not limited to reasonable attorneys’ fees made by such parties, connected with or arising out of:
