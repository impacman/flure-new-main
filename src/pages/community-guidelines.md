## Flure Etiquette 101

At Flure, we take pride in creating a safe and inclusive community. We understand that the online dating world can be difficult to navigate, and we’re here to change that. We strive to build a community that is as safe and inclusive as possible. To achieve that, we have established some important guidelines we expect all community members to follow.

## Be SEEN!

We don’t allow photos depicting minors, scenes of violence, genitalia, pornographic content, offensive content, sensitive information, or photos of caught sea creatures. For your main profile photo, you should be alone, and your face should be visible.

## Respect over drama

Kindness and decency are the foundations of a vibrant community. So even if you don’t agree with someone, treat them with respect. We don’t tolerate hate speech, discrimination, or harassment of any kind. 

## Keep it clean

We want Flure to be a safe space for everyone, so please keep all content and language appropriate. Always ask for consent; don’t send anything unsolicited. Remember — no means no, and yes means yes. Posting or sharing violent or offensive material is strictly prohibited.

## Positive vibes only

We encourage healthy and constructive discussions, but please do not disrupt the community by spamming, trolling, or creating multiple accounts. 

## Your secrets are safe

No, you can’t make a screenshot of anything on Flure. Respect other people’s privacy, too. We’re not on a reality TV show, so don’t share someone’s personal information without explicit consent. Sensitive or confidential information, such as financial or medical data, is also off-limits. 

## Make a difference

Last but not least, if you see any behavior that violates our guidelines, <a href="mailto:support@flure.com">please report it to us</a> ASAP. We investigate all reports to take appropriate action, including removing content and suspending or terminating accounts. Think of us like your friendly neighborhood watch. 

By joining the Flure community, you agree to follow these guidelines and help us create an exciting, welcoming, and safe environment for everyone. Now, let’s have some fun. 

*We reserve the right to modify or update these guidelines at anytime.
